Title: Soil Organic Carbon Model based on MEND by Want et al. 2015
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Taylor Hietpas
Maintainer: Jianqiu Zheng <jianqiu.zheng@pnnl.gov>
Description: Can be used to process data for parameterization of values for the model with appropriate parameter-specific data sets. The model can solve for average, maximum, and minimunm plot ranges based on optimization or approximation. The parameterized model can also be calibrated to a given time-series data set, via objective function minimization, with appropriate Soil Organic Carbon pool data points.
